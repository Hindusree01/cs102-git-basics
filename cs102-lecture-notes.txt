In today's lecture, I learnt basics of how to use Visual Studio Code. At first sir explained about the extensions that are used in Visual studio code.
Then thought about the extension called Markdown all in one. Which helps to create one's own web page. Then thought us how to create a folder and file. 
File name like README.md are recommended. Then I installed markdown extension. Started creating my own webpage using it. The basic thing to start the webpage
were thought. The basic thing to start with in a webpage are Main title and Subtitles. We have to use "#" before a line to make it a Main TItle. Similarly 
"##" before a line to make it a Subtitle and "###" before to make it sub-sub title. at top right we have a option called preview in which we can get the
result of work we done.
